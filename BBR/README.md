### Set BBR on server Automatically

Open bbr acceleration can help shadowsocks to be speeding up. But do this thing manually is boring, and time-consuming.  

Especially on a new cloud server. You may reinstall or change to another service provider by accident, so in order to get a good network with shadowsocks, you have to open bbr acceleration again manually.  

Now I write a simple script to do this thing for you, all the command inside is lucid.  
It is actually combining those command, and **no error detect module** inside.  
Once error occurs, you can simply rerun the script.
